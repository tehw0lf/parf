% This script was written by Robert Weyres in 2015 and adapted for public usage in 2022.
% A fork of randomforest-matlab used in this script can be found at https://github.com/jrderuiter/randomforest-matlab.
%
% The purpose of this function is to run prediction on multiple threads to save time.
% 
% The script takes the following input parameters
%
% data - the data set to run the prediction on
% model - the trained model
% diarypath - the path to the diary used to reconstruct the order after prediction
% varargin - num_threads, the number of threads to predict with - if not specified, num_threads is set to 25
